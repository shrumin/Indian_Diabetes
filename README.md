Machine learning approach
This dataset was taken from kaggle.Supervised machine learning models have been used like Logistic Regression,Random Forest and Stochastis Gradient Descent and XGBoost.
In order to improve model performace the zeros were replaced with the mean values which improved the model accuracy from 80 percent to 90 percent.
